### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. **MongoDB Connection Error**: Make sure your connection string is correct and you've replaced the username and password with your actual credentials.

2. **Build Errors**: Check the Vercel deployment logs for any specific errors.

3. **World ID Verification Issues**: Ensure your app ID and action name match exactly what's in your World ID Developer Portal.

4. **Blank Page After Deployment**: Try clearing your browser cache or opening in an incognito window.

For any other issues, refer to the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs) or [MongoDB Atlas documentation](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/).
